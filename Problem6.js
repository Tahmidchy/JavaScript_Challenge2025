TODO: Problem-6: Log the console 10 times using a while loop - "I will practice programming for at least 3 hours every day."
*/

// Solution: 

let i = 0; // Initialize a counter variable
while (i <= 10){
    console.log("I will practice programming for at least 3 hours every day."); // Log the message to the console
    i++; // Increment the counter variable by 1
    // The loop will continue until the counter variable is less than or equal to 10
}
