//TODO: Example Test Here:

const money = 25;
const rich = money + 100;
console.log(rich); // Output: 125

// In here using Const keyword to declare a variable named money and assign it the value of 25. Then, we create another variable named rich and assign it the value of money plus 100. Finally, we log the value of rich to the console, which will output 125.
