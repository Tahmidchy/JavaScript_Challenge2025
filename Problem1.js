TODO: Problem-1: You know that there are 1760 yards in a mile. So write a function that can find out how many yards are in 13 miles.

*/

// Solution :

function YeardsInMiles(miles){
    // 1 mile = 1760 yards
    const YeardsInMiles = 1760;
    return miles * yeardsInMiles;
}
// Test the function
console.log(YeardsInMiles(13));
