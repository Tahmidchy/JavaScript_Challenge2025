TODO: Problem-7: You use a while loop to log the numbers from 1 to 20 to the console.
*/

// Solution: 

let i = 1; // Initialize a counter variable starting from 1
while(i <= 20){
    console.log(i); // Log the current value of the counter variable to the console
    i++; // Increment the counter variable by 1
    // The loop will continue until the counter variable is less than or equal to 20
    // This will log the numbers from 1 to 20 to the console
}
