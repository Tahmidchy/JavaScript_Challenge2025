TODO: Problem-4: In the scorching heat, I placed my hand on my forehead and felt a high fever. At this moment, I have declared a variable named `temperature`, which has a value of 102.5. Now, if I check this variable using `typeof`, what type of variable will it be?
 */

//Solution:

let temperature = 102.5;
console.log(typeof temperature); // Output: "number"
