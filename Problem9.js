TODO: Problem -9: When printing the numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop, you need to multiply the numbers by 3.
*/

// Solution:

let i = 1; // Initialize a counter variable starting from 1
while(i <=10){
    console.log(i * 3); // Log the current value of the counter variable multiplied by 3 to the console
    i++; // Increment the counter variable by 1
    // The loop will continue until the counter variable is less than or equal to 10
    // This will log the numbers from 1 to 10 multiplied by 3 to the console
    // The output will be: 3, 6, 9, ..., 30
    // The output will be: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30
