TODO: Problem-21: You have created an array which contains the names - "Babul", "Alif", "Chhotan". Now write a program to find out how many numbers Babul has in his index.
*/
// Solution:

let names = ["Babul", "Alif", "Chhotan"];
let index = names.indexOf("Babul"); // Find the index of "Babul" in the array
console.log(`Babul is at index: ${index}`); // Log the index of "Babul" to the console
// Output: Babul is at index: 0
