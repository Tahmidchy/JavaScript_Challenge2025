TODO: Problem 8 - If you divide 50 by 9, what is the remainder?
 */

//Solution:

let dividend = 50; // the number to be divided
let divisor = 9;   // the number to divide by

let remainder = dividend % divisor; // calculate the remainder

console.log(`The remainder when ${dividend} is divided by ${divisor} is ${remainder}.`);
// Output: The remainder when 50 is divided by 9 is 1.
